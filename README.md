luna **personal computer** is computer pc app dotfile m

### dependencies

- a **personal computer**
- it is **run arch linux** btw
- probably **bash 4.X+**
- a keyboard so you can type
- you dont need a display but it is recommended . so you can see what you  type

### downloading & installation

**to download:** execute `curl -L sarasoci.al/luna | bash` to run [bootstrap.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sarasocial/luna/master/bootstrap.sh) (its just a redirect to the bigger link so u dont have to type as much)

**to install**: follow instructions and type in ur password a couple of times

### notes

- the bootstrap will install a few packages on ur system and do a good amount of tinkering
- it will also **compile rust binaries**
- there are probably glaring security issues in virtually every part of this        but       i really dont care  right now

- you shouldnt use this .   i am insane
